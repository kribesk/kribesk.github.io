## Revision

  * What is matrix?
  * Operations:
      - Sum
      - Multiply by scalar
      - Multiplication
      - Transpose

## Understanding matricies

  * Mapping $I \times J \to R$
  * Table with numbers
  * Graph

  . . .

  * System of linear equations
  * Linear operator
  * Bilinear form
  * Automata and Markov chain

## Understanding matrisies: linear space

  * $V_R$ --- linear space over $R$ --- scalars
  * Has operations: sum, multiply by scalar
  * Linear closure: $<v^{(1)}, \ldots, v^{(n)}> = \{\alpha_1 v^{(1)}1 + \ldots + \alpha_n v^{(n)}, \alpha_i \in R \} \subset V_R$
  * Basis --- minimal $<v_1, \ldots, v_n> = V_R$
  * $\dim V = n$ if $<v_1, \ldots, v_n> = V_R$

  . . .

  __Ex__: $R = \mathbb{R}, V = \mathbb{R}^n$. Vectors are $v = (v_1, \ldots, v_n)$. Standard basis:
  $$e_1 = (1, 0, \ldots, 0)$$
  $$e_2 = (0, 1, \ldots, 0)$$
  $$e_n = (0, \ldots, 0, 1)$$
  $$e_i^{(j)} = \delta_{ij}$$

## Understanding matricies: linear mapping

  __Def__: $f \colon X_R \to Y_R$ is linear, iff $f(\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha f(x) + \beta f(y)$.

  __Th__: Let $L(X, Y)$ be a set of all linear mappings $X_R \to Y_R$, $n = \dim X$, $m = \dim Y$.
          Than $L(X, Y) = M(n, m, R)$ (up to isomorphism).

  But what means linear mapping in linear space?

## Understanding matricies: system of linear equations

Kelly's definition of multiplication lets us to write 
system of linear equations in matrix form:

 $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{ccccccc}
      a_{11} x_1 & + & \ldots & + & a_{1n} x_n & = & b_1 \\
                 & + & \ldots & + &            & = &     \\
      a_{m1} x_1 & + & \ldots & + & a_{mn} x_n & = & b_m \\
    \end{array} \right.
 $$

 $$ Ax = b $$

 How do we solve such systems?

## Gauss algo: step 1

>  * Staircase form
>  * What operations we performed?

## Gauss algo: step 2

  * Eliminating variables
  * What operations we performed? 

## Gauss algo and matricies: $LU$-decomposition

  * Step 1 of Gauss algo gives (under some constraints) triangular matrix
  * Operations performed during this step also can be represented with triangular matrix
  * This is $A = LU$, $L$ --- matrix of operations, $U$ --- simplified $A$
